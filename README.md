# MotorMap_Analysis

This code was written to perform and analyze motor maps in laboratory animals. In the "Map Creation" folder is a program that can be used to enter motor map data into the computer. This can either be done during the motor map procedure or afterwards (if the map is recorded on paper). This program was originally written by Drew Sloan, but I made some large revisions to it to allow some extra functionality.

In the "Map Analysis" folder is some code that I wrote to do analysis of the motor map data. It allows loading the mapping data into Matlab after it has been entered into the computer with the aforementioned program, and then it puts it into a nice structured form that makes it easy to do analysis. 

Finally, the last folder "Example Plot" has some example figures that I created using my analysis code. Feel free to ask any questions or use the code for your own motor mapping procedures and analysis.
